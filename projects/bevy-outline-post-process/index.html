<p>this plugin allows you to add outlines to a camera as a post-processing effect in the bevy engine</p>
<p><img src="https://exvacuum.dev/projects/bevy-outline-post-process/threshold_10.png" alt="0.1 threshold, 2.0 thickness" /></p>
<p>the effect makes use of a normal prepass to determine surface normals of objects in view, and then uses the differences between those normal values to determine where outlines should occur</p>
<p>the effect is configurable, you can change the thickness of the outlines and the threshold (how significant the difference between normals need to be for an outline to appear)</p>

<p>there's also an option to enable <em>adaptive outlines</em>, so that darker areas get outlined with white and brighter areas are outlined with black</p>

<p>i created this effect to improve visual contrast in my game project, which is why i haven't added support for different colors</p>
<p>you're free to add it yourself though, probably wouldn't be too hard</p>
