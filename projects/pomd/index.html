<p>this was a pretty simple rust project i did over the course of a couple days</p>
<p>i had been wanting to experiment with d-bus on linux for a while and figured that writing a pomodoro daemon and client would be a good way to understand the basics of how d-bus interfaces work</p>
<p>luckily i found the wonderful <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/zbus">zbus</a> crate which made everything for hooking up interface super simple</p>
<p>i think the hardest thing about this project was trying to figure out how to accurately keep the time left in the timer</p>
<p>as with many problems in rust the solution ended up being to find a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/pausable_clock">crate</a> that implemented a "pausable clock" that worked similarly to a normal rust <code>std::time::Instant</code></p>
<p>it's pretty configurable from what i remember</p>
<p>i used this program when i was using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a> and wanted a daemon to integrate into my statusbar</p>
<p><img src="https://exvacuum.dev/projects/pomd/statusbar.png" alt="pomd segment in my dwm statusbar" /></p>
<p>now i use KDE plasma which has a pretty good pomodoro applet available, maybe in the future i could make some kind of widget that communicates with the daemon</p>
