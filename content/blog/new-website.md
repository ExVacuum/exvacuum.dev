dear witness,

this is the first post on my new website, which i'm creating using the [zola](https://www.getzola.org) static site generator

the old site used [jekyll](jekyllrb.com), which i like a lot, and i've used it for over 5 years

<br/>

i always found the ruby development environment to be a massive pain in the ass to set up, which is why zola was pretty appealing

i also never use ruby for damn near anything, so i never keep it installed

i've also just been meaning to change things up a little in general

the whole early web 2.0 aesthetic is a lot of fun, but i've been feeling a bit more drawn towards minimalism lately

besides, i was barely even sentient when that aesthetic was big

<br/>

i might port over the old posts

might not

some of that stuff was pretty cool

you can always check out the internet archive to see that stuff if you want: [http://web.archive.org/web/20240226014714/https://exvacuum.dev/notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20240226014714/https://exvacuum.dev/notes)

<br/>

idk why i decided to write like this but it's kind of funny

a bit rambly

it's actually really annoying trying to intentionally write poorly

<br/>

i do want to start writing more of these things because god i feel like i learn so much and don't have anywhere to share it

like i have my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@silasbartha), which is great when i can muster up the willpower to throw something together, but i don't feel like my skills are developed enough to output videos at a rate or quality which would satisfy me

i would be spending more time on videos about my projects than the projects themselves

<br/>

i'm actually putting off my big personal project right now to do this lol

but it's important (i think)

my site's on my resume and i'm looking for jobs right now

if you're a potential employer reading this, first of all: i'm surprised you read this far!

but also please hire me or something

not for frontend web development obviously

<br/>

thanks for reading this,

\- silas
