this plugin is pretty simple, it just allows you to set up a render texture to be extracted for use on the CPU every frame

i made this plugin as part of the [white (I)](@/projects/white_I/index.md) project super early on when i needed a copy of the rendered frame in the main world to be rendered as braille to the screen
