	time for a new website
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-08-13</strong></p>
<p>dear witness,</p>
<p>this is the first post on my new website, which i'm creating using the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getzola.org">zola</a> static site generator</p>
<p>the old site used <a href="https://exvacuum.dev/blog/new-website/jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, which i like a lot, and i've used it for over 5 years</p>
<br/>
<p>i always found the ruby development environment to be a massive pain in the ass to set up, which is why zola was pretty appealing</p>
<p>i also never use ruby for damn near anything, so i never keep it installed</p>
<p>i've also just been meaning to change things up a little in general</p>
<p>the whole early web 2.0 aesthetic is a lot of fun, but i've been feeling a bit more drawn towards minimalism lately</p>
<p>besides, i was barely even sentient when that aesthetic was big</p>
<br/>
<p>i might port over the old posts</p>
<p>might not</p>
<p>some of that stuff was pretty cool</p>
<p>you can always check out the internet archive to see that stuff if you want: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240226014714/https://exvacuum.dev/notes">http://web.archive.org/web/20240226014714/https://exvacuum.dev/notes</a></p>
<br/>
<p>idk why i decided to write like this but it's kind of funny</p>
<p>a bit rambly</p>
<p>it's actually really annoying trying to intentionally write poorly</p>
<br/>
<p>i do want to start writing more of these things because god i feel like i learn so much and don't have anywhere to share it</p>
<p>like i have my <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/@silasbartha">youtube channel</a>, which is great when i can muster up the willpower to throw something together, but i don't feel like my skills are developed enough to output videos at a rate or quality which would satisfy me</p>
<p>i would be spending more time on videos about my projects than the projects themselves</p>
<br/>
<p>i'm actually putting off my big personal project right now to do this lol</p>
<p>but it's important (i think)</p>
<p>my site's on my resume and i'm looking for jobs right now</p>
<p>if you're a potential employer reading this, first of all: i'm surprised you read this far!</p>
<p>but also please hire me or something</p>
<p>not for frontend web development obviously</p>
<br/>
<p>thanks for reading this,</p>
<p>- silas</p>
